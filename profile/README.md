# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This organizations contains repositories to support and deploy various online interactive books for educational purposes! 

> Starting from the need to share educational materials in various forms with students, we have started a platform for teachers and students assistants to collaborate and share interactive textbooks.
> 
> Our philosophy is to make it possible, practical and fun for all teaching teams, regardless of experience. Because while TeachBooks can be made by individuals, we've seen that a team of teachers and student assistants can make a TeachBook that's more accessible, attractive, and more interactive than any one person could make alone. Such a team can work together on both content as innovative features, collaboratively creating a deep learning experience.
> 
> We'd like to share our experiences and platforms with anyone, and to learn and promote your content and TeachBook features as well! So whether your teaching team is unfamiliar and lost in the nerdy world of interactive books, or whether you're an expert having created your own library of TeachBooks with custom features: share and collaborate with the biggest and most effective teaching team you were ever part of!

We're still learning how to organise this, so feel free to help us! Contact Robert Lanzafame or Tom van Woudenberg via TeachBooks@tudelft.nl for additional information.

## Do you want to contribute?!
Awesome! To kickstart our collaboration, we've created an overview of the stuff we have:
- https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/, our website, which gives an overview of what we've to offer. Its raw HTML source files are actually on GitLab: https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/homepage
- https://jupyterbook.org/, the system we're using for our books. It takes .md and .ipynb files and converts them into an online book (at the moment using Sphinx, another packages)
- https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/jupyter-book-manual, our manual, which explains how to do collaborative book-editing for eduactional purposes, our tooling, some examples and some editing tools.
  https://github.com/TeachBooks/template, our template, which allows you to start your book within 10 clicks!
- https://github.com/TeachBooks, our GitHub organization you're looking at now, where we actually do stuff. This organization includes:
  - Repositories with tooling which can be imported into the book building process (sphinx extensions)
  - Tooling to use during book development
  - Tooling to improve the student experience
  - Books (some are mirrored, those are actually located on GitLab but are mirrored to GitHub becuase of the extensive tooling)
  - Sandbox and some special repos used for testing
- https://github.com/orgs/TeachBooks/discussions, discussions, where we discuss stuff which is very general, unrelated to specific project or not yet grown into a mature project. Start a discussion here to reach out to the community!
- https://github.com/orgs/TeachBooks/projects, our projects, all the stuff we're planning or actually working on.
- https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg, our GitLab group with some books which were never transferred to GitHub
- [Zenodo TeachBooks organization](https://zenodo.org/communities/teachbooks/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest), a Zenodo organization containing the presentation of public talks

Depending on the project you'll be working on, you'll get rights to the full organization or to specific repositories. Or fork a repo to start immediately!

## First steps
If you've no idea where to start, but would like to contribute, we'd advise going through the 'Getting start' part our manual: https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/jupyter-book-manual!

If you've some ideas to work on yourself, go ahead, fork a repo or reach out to use at TeachBooks@tudelft.nl. If you've no idea where to start, reach out to us as well (TeachBooks@tudelft.nl) and we'll find you a nice project which fits your skills.
